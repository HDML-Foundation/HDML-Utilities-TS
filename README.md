# HDML-Utilities Monorepo

The **HDML-Utilities** monorepo is a collection of utility packages designed to simplify the management, parsing, and manipulation of **HDML** (HyperData Markup Language) documents. It provides a set of tools to work with hierarchical data models, enabling seamless integration with web and database systems.

This monorepo contains several independently versioned packages, each focused on a different aspect of working with HDML and associated data structures.

## Packages in the Monorepo

### @hdml/schemas

Provides TypeScript types generated by FlatBuffers, defining the core HyperData object model. These types ensure efficient and compact serialization and deserialization of HDML documents.

### @hdml/types

Defines the core TypeScript interfaces for HDML documents and their associated components. This module provides types for manipulating HDML documents, models, frames, and connections.

### @hdml/parser

A set of utility functions to parse **HTML** and **HDML** strings into **DOM** and **HDOM** objects, enabling further manipulation and traversal of the document structure.

### @hdml/stringlifier

A suite of functions to convert HDML data structures into **SQL** or **HTML** string representations for easy integration into web and database workflows.

### @hdml/hash

Provides utility functions for hashing and generating unique identifiers. Includes MD5 hashing, UUID generation, and timestamp-based hashing functions.

### @hdml/buffer

Utility functions to serialize and deserialize HDML data structures using FlatBuffers. This package handles the conversion of complex HDML objects into a compact binary format for storage or transmission.

## Usage

Once the required package(s) are installed, you can import and use them as needed. For example:

```typescript
import { parseHDML } from "@hdml/parser";
import { HDOM } from "@hdml/types";

const hdmlString = "<hdml-model>...</hdml-model>";
const hdom: HDOM = parseHDML(hdmlString);
console.log(hdom);
```

## Development

### Setup

git clone git@github.com:HDML-Foundation/HDML-Utilities-TS.git
cd HDML-Utilities-TS
git submodule update --init --recursive
npm install
```

### Build
